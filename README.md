### compilation

all drivers are provided as out-of-tree source files so compilation is as easy as

```
make
```

if you're using a kernel based on the mainline 6.7 tree then make sure to read about the required [patch](linux-iio_property).

### device tree overlay

dts overlay files are provided for BeagleBoneÂ® Black devboards for each driver and each bus type. conversion to dtbo is provided via

```
make dtbs
```
