title: Honeywell TruStability ABP pressure sensor series

description: |
  Support for Honeywell TruStability ABP digital pressure sensor series.

  These sensors have an I2C and SPI interface.

  There are 56 models with different pressure ranges available in each family.
  The vendor calls them "ABP series". All of them have an identical programming
  model but differ in pressure range, unit and transfer function.

  To support different models one needs to specify the pressure range as well
  as the transfer function.

  The transfer function defines both the ranges of raw conversion values
  delivered by the sensor and the capabilities (temperature output and sleep
  mode are optional features).

  In case of a custom silicon chip that has a specific measurement range the
  pmin-pascal and pmax-pascal properties need to be defined as numeric range
  limits converted to pascals.

  Specifications about the devices can be found at:
