## Honeywell TruStabilityâ„¢ ABP Series pressure sensor - iio device driver

Linux kernel driver for all digital variants of the [ABP family](https://sps.honeywell.com/us/en/products/advanced-sensing-technologies/healthcare-sensing/board-mount-pressure-sensors/basic-abp-series#resources) of sensors.
both i2c and spi interface versions are covered by this library.

ChangeLog:

 * refactor code so that driver can use either i2c or spi as communication bus
 * add spi driver (tested on ABPDANV030PGSA3)
 * add transfer-function property to get the chip capabilities
 * send wakeup sequence only if required by capabilities
 * add triggered buffer

```
&i2c2 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&spi0_pins>;

	pressure@ADDR {
		compatible = "honeywell,VARIANT";
		reg = <ADDR>;
		spi-max-frequency = <800000>;
		honeywell,transfer-function = <TRANSFER_FUNCTION_ID>;
		vdd-supply = <&ldo4_reg>;
                status = "okay";
	};
};
```

where ```ADDR``` is the assigned i2c address: either ```0x08```, ```0x18```, ```0x28```, ```0x38```, ```0x48```, ```0x58```, ```0x68``` or ```0x78```.

The transfer function limits define the raw output of the sensor at a given pressure input and the chip's capabilities

```TRANSFER_FUNCTION_ID``` | nomenclature | info | capabilities
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | A | 10% to 90% of 2^14 counts | none
1 | D | 10% to 90% of 2^14 counts | temperature, sleep mode
2 | S | 10% to 90% of 2^14 counts | sleep mode
3 | T | 10% to 90% of 2^14 counts | temperature

in case it's a custom chip with a different measurement range then the limits can be set via pmin-pascal, pmax-pascal

```
        pressure@ADDR {
                compatible = "honeywell,VARIANT";
                reg = <ADDR>;
                honeywell,transfer-function = <TRANSFER_FUNCTION_ID>;
                honeywell,pmin-pascal = <(-4000000)>;
                honeywell,pmax-pascal = <200000>;
                status = "okay";
        };
```

```(double) (raw + offset) * scale``` provides the pressure in KPa and temperature in milli degrees C, as per the IIO ABI requirements.
